Set waypoint and drive towards while calculating gradient. If gradient is negative:
  when obstacle detected, compare its coordinates to list of known obstacles,
  if new obstacle, add to obstacle list,
if gradient is positive:
  place an intermediate waypoint behind the offending obstacle on your path
  use potential field algorithm to calculate the best path around the obstacle to the next waypoint
